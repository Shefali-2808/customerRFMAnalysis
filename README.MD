### RFM Segmentation & Visualizations
> **What it shows**:
> - **Recency** (days since last purchase)
> - **Frequency** (number of unique orders)
> - **Monetary** (total sales)

These metrics are combined into an **RFM DataFrame** and visualized to guide loyalty campaigns, personalization, and retention.

#### Recency Distribution
![Recency Distribution](plots/recency_distribution.png)

- **Most customers haven't purchased recently**, highlighting a need for **reactivation campaigns**.

#### Frequency Distribution
![Frequency Distribution](plots/frequency_distribution.png)

- A **small percentage of customers** make repeated purchases.
- **Recommendation**: Encourage repeat purchases with **discounts and email marketing**.

#### Monetary Distribution
![Monetary Distribution](plots/monetary_distribution.png)

- A **few high-value customers** contribute significantly to total sales.
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize **high-value customers** for VIP programs and premium services.

#### RFM Pairplot

## Final Insights

### 1. **Sales by Country**
